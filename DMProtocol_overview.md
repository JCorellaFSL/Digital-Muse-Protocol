- **Character Graph**: Personalities, relationships, development arcs
- **World Graph**: Locations, rules, environmental details  
- **Plot Graph**: Events, conflicts, timelines, causality
- **Narrative Graph**: Chapters, pacing, thematic structure
- **Master Graph**: Overall coordination and cross-domain references

**Setup**: Use `federated_mcp_config.json` for complex projects or `mcp_memory_config.json` for simple ones.

## **System Overview**

***

#### **Phase 0: Pre-Project Planning**

**Objective:** Establish project parameters, research requirements, and success metrics before engaging the LLM. This phase ensures the project has clear boundaries and realistic expectations.

**Steps:**

1. **Target Audience Definition (Human):** Clearly define the intended readership (e.g., "Young Adult Urban Fantasy readers," "Hard Sci-Fi enthusiasts," "Literary Fiction audience"). This will guide tone, pacing, and content decisions.
2. **Research Requirements (Human):** Identify any specialized knowledge needed (historical periods, scientific concepts, cultural elements) and compile research materials.
3. **Timeline & Milestone Planning (Human):** Establish realistic deadlines for each phase, including buffer time for revisions and quality control.
4. **Success Metrics (Human):** Define what constitutes a successful completion (target word count, quality standards, publication readiness level).
5. **Resource Allocation (Human):** Determine time commitment, backup strategies, and contingency plans for potential setbacks.

***

#### **Phase 1: Project Initialization & Foundational Context**

**Objective:** Establish a high-level creative roadmap and a clear set of constraints to guide all subsequent LLM activity. This phase requires significant human-LLM interaction.

**Steps:**

1.  **Project Setup (Human):** Create a new **GitHub repository**. Inside, create a `README.md` file. This file will serve as the master control document for the entire project.
2.  **Initial Prompt (Human):** In the Cursor IDE, initiate a chat with the LLM. The initial prompt should be structured and contain the following elements:
    * **Core Request:** "We are going to write a book. You will act as the author, and I will act as the editor and project manager. We will follow a strict, iterative protocol. Do you understand?"
    * **Book Concept:** Provide a concise, 1-2 sentence logline for the story idea.
    * **Genre & Tone:** Explicitly define the primary and secondary genres (e.g., "Hard Sci-Fi, Cyberpunk, Mystery") and the desired tone (e.g., "Gritty, noir-inspired, cynical").
    * **Length & Pacing:** Specify the target word count or chapter count, and the desired pacing (e.g., "Slow burn with a high-stakes climax").
3.  **Roadmap Generation (LLM):** The LLM will generate a high-level roadmap based on the human's input. This roadmap will include:
    * `1-` `Book Title Options`
    * `2-` `Synopsis` (a more detailed summary of the plot).
    * `3-` `Primary Story Arcs` (1-3 major plot threads).
    * `4-` `Chapter Count and Structure` (a proposed number of chapters and a brief description of the story's overall progression).
4.  **Roadmap Review & Sign-off (Human):** The human operator reviews the generated roadmap. The operator will either approve it or provide specific, targeted feedback for the LLM to refine. The approved roadmap will be moved into a new **`Roadmap.md` file** in the repository.
5.  **Quality Assurance Framework Setup (Human):** Create a **`QA_Checklist.md` file** containing:
    * Character voice consistency guidelines
    * World-building fact-checking procedures
    * Timeline verification requirements
    * Style guide parameters
    * Anti-generalization detection criteria

***

#### **Phase 2: Structured World & Character Building**

**Objective:** Create a detailed, interconnected world and cast of characters that will serve as the source material for the story. The goal is to build a "contextual database" that the LLM can reference, preventing it from inventing generic details on the fly.

**Steps:**

1.  **Folder Creation (LLM):** Instruct the LLM to create a new folder structure within the repository:
    * `./book/characters/`
    * `./book/world/`
    * `./book/plots/`
    * `./book/memory/` (for knowledge graph database)
2.  **Character Profiles (LLM):** Within the `characters/` folder, the LLM will create a markdown file for each major character (e.g., `protagonist.md`, `antagonist.md`). Each file will contain:
    * `Name`
    * `Core Motivation` (A single, driving desire).
    * `Fatal Flaw` (A specific personality trait that causes internal conflict).
    * `Character Arc` (A concise description of their emotional journey).
    * `Physical Description`
3.  **World-building and Plot Outlines (LLM):** The LLM will populate the other folders with specific markdown files:
    * `./book/world/locations.md`: Detailed descriptions of key settings.
    * `./book/world/lore.md`: Information on the history, politics, or magic of the world.
    * `./book/plots/arc_1_summary.md`: A detailed outline of the first major story arc.
4.  **Review & Sign-off (Human):** The human operator reviews each markdown file for consistency, originality, and depth. Any generic or underdeveloped concepts are challenged, and the LLM is instructed to revise with specific feedback. **Sign-off is mandatory for each file.**
5.  **Cross-Reference Matrix (LLM):** Create a **`consistency_matrix.md` file** that maps character relationships, location connections, and plot dependencies. This serves as a quick-reference guide to prevent contradictions.
6.  **Knowledge Graph Memory Setup (Human):** Configure a federated MCP knowledge graph system:
    * **Option A - Single Graph**: Configure `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` with local storage: `./book/memory/dm_protocol_memory.json`
    * **Option B - Federated System** (Recommended for complex projects): Deploy multiple specialized graphs:
      - `master_story_graph.json`: Overall story coordination and cross-domain references
      - `character_graph.json`: Character development, relationships, and arcs
      - `world_graph.json`: Locations, world-building, and environmental details
      - `plot_graph.json`: Events, conflicts, and plot thread development
      - `narrative_graph.json`: Chapter structure, pacing, and thematic development
    * Create entities and relations within each domain graph
    * Use cross-references (e.g., `character_graph::Sarah_Chen`) to link between domains
    * All databases stored locally within project structure for version control and portability
    * Provides specialized, high-performance memory across all writing sessions
7.  **Backup & Version Control (Human):** Establish branching strategy for major revisions and create initial backup of all approved world-building materials.

***

#### **Phase 3: Iterative Chapter Generation**

**Objective:** Write the book, chapter by chapter, by referencing the approved context files and applying a "show, don't tell" methodology to minimize high-level generalizations.

**Steps:**

1.  **Pre-Chapter Prompt (Human):** Before each chapter, the human provides a detailed prompt to the LLM. This prompt will include:
    * **Chapter Focus:** "Write Chapter 1. It should introduce the protagonist, their fatal flaw, and the inciting incident. We will be using the approved files in the `/book` folder for all details."
    * **Specific Scene-Level Goals:** "The chapter should open in a busy tavern. The innkeeper, Bob, has a limp. The protagonist is eating a meal." This is where you directly inject granular, specific details to prevent the LLM from creating generic scenarios.
2.  **Chapter Generation (LLM):** The LLM will write the chapter and save it as **`chapter_1.md`**. Crucially, the LLM is now operating with a rich set of self-generated and human-approved context.
3.  **Chapter Review & Refinement (Human):** The human operator reads the chapter. The focus of the review is on:
    * **Cohesion:** Does it adhere to the plot and character files?
    * **Prose Quality:** Is the writing dynamic and engaging?
    * **Generalization Check:** This is the most critical step. The human will actively search for and challenge "grand sweeping generalizations."
    * **Correction Loop:** If a generalization is found (e.g., "He had a feeling that all of humanity was doomed"), the human provides specific feedback (e.g., "Rewrite this. Instead of a sweeping generalization, focus on the character's immediate, visceral reaction to the events. Show his specific fear, don't tell me about the abstract 'doom of humanity.'"). The LLM then revises the chapter.
4.  **Iteration Management:** Before committing, check the consistency matrix and update it with any new details introduced in the chapter. For major revisions:
    * Create a new branch (e.g., `chapter-1-revision-2`)
    * Maintain change log in **`revision_notes.md`**
    * Implement rollback procedures if needed
5.  **Commit & Repeat:** Once a chapter is approved, it is committed to the GitHub repository. This process repeats for every chapter until the book is complete.

***

#### **Phase 4: Post-Generation Quality Assurance**

**Objective:** Conduct comprehensive editing and prepare the completed manuscript for publication or distribution.

**Steps:**

1.  **Comprehensive Consistency Audit (Human):** Review the entire manuscript for:
    * Character voice consistency across all chapters
    * Timeline accuracy and logical progression
    * World-building element consistency
    * Plot thread resolution
2.  **Style and Flow Editing (Human):** Conduct multiple editing passes:
    * **Pass 1:** Structural editing (plot, pacing, character arcs)
    * **Pass 2:** Line editing (prose quality, dialogue, descriptions)
    * **Pass 3:** Copy editing (grammar, punctuation, formatting)
3.  **Knowledge Graph Validation (Human & LLM):** Use the MCP memory server to:
    * Query for character consistency violations
    * Verify timeline accuracy through entity relationships
    * Check for plot thread continuity across chapters
    * Identify orphaned story elements or missing connections
4.  **Beta Reader Integration (Human):** 
    * Select 3-5 beta readers from target audience
    * Provide structured feedback forms focusing on engagement, clarity, and genre expectations
    * Implement feedback through targeted revisions
4.  **Final Anti-Generalization Sweep (Human & LLM):** Conduct one final review specifically targeting any remaining generic phrases or concepts that may have slipped through.
5.  **Publication Preparation (Human):** Format the manuscript according to intended publication method (traditional submission, self-publishing, etc.)

***

#### **Iteration Management Best Practices**

**Git Workflow:**
* **Main Branch:** Contains only approved, final versions
* **Development Branches:** For active chapter writing (`chapter-X-draft`)
* **Revision Branches:** For major reworking (`chapter-X-revision-Y`)
* **Feature Branches:** For adding new characters or plot elements (`add-character-name`)

**Change Tracking:**
* All LLM outputs must include rationale for changes
* Human approvals must document specific criteria met
* Major revisions require updated consistency matrix

**Recovery Procedures:**
* Daily automated backups of entire repository
* Milestone snapshots before each new phase
* Clear rollback procedures documented in `recovery_guide.md`

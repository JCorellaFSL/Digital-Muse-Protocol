## **Digital Muse Protocol - Phase 0: Pre-Project Planning**

### **Purpose**
Establish clear project parameters, research requirements, and success metrics before engaging AI in content generation. This phase ensures the project has realistic boundaries and prevents scope creep during implementation.

---

## **Phase Overview**

**Duration**: 1-3 days  
**Objective**: Define project scope, constraints, and success criteria  
**Knowledge Graph Role**: Initialize master story coordination  
**Output**: Complete project specification and planning documents  

### **Why This Phase Matters**
- **Prevents Scope Creep**: Clear boundaries established before creative work begins
- **Sets Quality Standards**: Define what "success" looks like for this specific project
- **Identifies Resources**: Determine research needs and skill requirements
- **Establishes Timeline**: Realistic scheduling prevents rushed or abandoned projects
- **Creates Accountability**: Measurable goals enable progress tracking

## **Common Pitfalls & Solutions**

### **Pitfall 1: Overly Ambitious Scope**
**Problem**: Setting unrealistic word counts or timelines
**Solution**: Research average writing speeds and add 50% buffer time
**KG Check**: Review project_timeline observations for realism

### **Pitfall 2: Insufficient Research Planning**
**Problem**: Discovering major knowledge gaps during writing
**Solution**: Spend extra time in research requirements identification
**KG Check**: Ensure research_requirements entity has comprehensive observations

### **Pitfall 3: Vague Success Criteria**
**Problem**: No clear definition of "done" or "good enough"
**Solution**: Define specific, measurable quality and completion metrics
**KG Check**: Verify success_metrics entity has quantifiable observations

### **Pitfall 4: Inadequate Support System**
**Problem**: Trying to complete complex project entirely alone
**Solution**: Plan beta reader recruitment and expert consultation early
**KG Check**: Review resource_allocation entity for support network planning

## **Transition to Phase 1**

### **Prerequisites for Phase 1**
âœ… **All Phase 0 deliverables completed**  
âœ… **Knowledge graph entities populated with planning data**  
âœ… **Project specification approved by stakeholders**  
âœ… **Research materials gathered and organized**  
âœ… **Writing schedule committed to and protected**  

### **Phase 1 Preparation**
Before moving to Phase 1 (Project Initialization):

1. **Review Planning Documents**: Ensure all specifications are clear and actionable
2. **Test Knowledge Graph Setup**: Verify MCP server responds correctly to planning entity queries
3. **Confirm Resource Availability**: Double-check that research materials and support network are ready
4. **Set Accountability Systems**: Establish progress tracking and check-in schedules

### **Success Validation**
Use the master story graph to validate Phase 0 completion:

```javascript
// Query all Phase 0 planning entities
"Search master_story for entities with type 'audience_profile', 'project_requirements', 'schedule', 'project_standards', 'project_resources'"

// Verify completeness
"Show all observations for target_audience, research_requirements, project_timeline, success_metrics, resource_allocation"

// Check for gaps
"Identify any planning entities with incomplete or vague observations"
```

**Phase 0 establishes the foundation for everything that follows. Invest the time here to prevent problems later - a well-planned project is a successful project.**

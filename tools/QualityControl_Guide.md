# Quality Control Guide

**Systematic procedures for maintaining consistency and eliminating generic language**

---

## 🎯 Quality Control Framework

### Core Quality Principles
1. **Prevention Over Correction**: Catch issues before they compound
2. **Systematic Detection**: Use repeatable procedures, not ad-hoc checking
3. **Knowledge Graph Validation**: Leverage persistent memory for consistency
4. **Measurable Standards**: Define specific, testable quality criteria
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular quality gates throughout all phases

### Quality Standards Benchmarks
```
Digital Muse Protocol Quality Targets:
✓ Anti-Generalization: <5% generic language in final prose
✓ Character Consistency: 95%+ actions align with established personality
✓ World Consistency: Zero contradictions in established rules/systems
✓ Cross-Reference Integrity: 98%+ valid knowledge graph references
✓ Sensory Anchoring: 90%+ scenes include specific physical details
```

## 🚫 Anti-Generalization Detection & Correction

### Generic Language Detection Patterns

#### Vague Emotion Indicators
```
High-Priority Patterns to Eliminate:

EMOTIONAL GENERICS:
❌ "felt [emotion]" → ✅ Replace with specific physical manifestation
❌ "was [emotion]" → ✅ Replace with character-specific behavioral response
❌ "seemed [emotion]" → ✅ Replace with observable details

EXAMPLES:
❌ Generic: "Sarah felt angry about the betrayal"
✅ Specific: "Sarah's jaw clenched as she deleted Marcus's email unread, 
    her fingernails leaving crescents in her palms"

❌ Generic: "The room was scary"  
✅ Specific: "Flickering fluorescents cast intermittent shadows across 
    the peeling conference table, each electrical buzz making Sarah's skin crawl"
```

#### Abstract Concept Detection
```
ABSTRACT PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- "justice/injustice" without concrete anchoring
- "freedom/oppression" without specific manifestation
- "destiny/fate" without character agency
- "humanity/inhumanity" without individual focus

CORRECTION STRATEGY:
1. Identify the abstract concept
2. Find the character experiencing it
3. Show through specific actions/consequences
4. Anchor in physical reality or character response

EXAMPLE:
❌ Generic: "Justice would prevail in the end"
✅ Specific: "The evidence folder grew thicker each day, each leaked 
    document another nail in Marcus's carefully constructed facade"
```

#### Generic Description Elimination
```
GENERIC ADJECTIVE PATTERNS:
❌ "dark/light" without specific source → ✅ Specific lighting description
❌ "loud/quiet" without sound ID → ✅ Particular sounds and volumes
❌ "big/small" without reference → ✅ Comparative measurements
❌ "beautiful/ugly" without perspective → ✅ Character-specific viewpoint

SENSORY ANCHORING REQUIREMENTS:
• Visual: Specific colors, lighting sources, shapes, movement
• Auditory: Particular sounds, volumes, tones, rhythms  
• Tactile: Textures, temperatures, pressures, sensations
• Olfactory: Specific scents tied to memories/atmosphere
• Kinesthetic: Movement, gesture, spatial relationships
```

## 🔍 Systematic Quality Control Procedures

### Chapter-Level Generic Language Audit
```javascript
// After each chapter completion:

// Generic emotion detection
"Search chapter text for: 'felt [emotion]', 'was [emotion]', 'seemed [emotion]'"
"Replace each instance with character-specific physical manifestation"

// Abstract concept detection  
"Search chapter text for: 'justice', 'freedom', 'destiny', 'fate', 'humanity'"
"Replace with concrete character actions and specific consequences"

// Generic description detection
"Search chapter text for: 'very', 'really', 'quite' + generic adjectives"
"Replace with specific sensory details and character perspective"
```

### Character Consistency Monitoring
```javascript
// Character voice validation
"Search character_memory for [character] voice patterns"
"Compare recent dialogue against established speech characteristics"
"Flag any dialogue that could be spoken by multiple characters"

// Behavioral consistency checking
"Search character actions in chapter against personality traits"
"Identify responses that contradict established character patterns"
"Verify character knowledge aligns with their story involvement"
```

### World Consistency Tracking
```javascript
// World rule enforcement
"Search world_memory for established rules/systems"
"Verify chapter events comply with world limitations"
"Check technology usage against established capabilities"

// Geographic and cultural consistency
"Validate location descriptions against world_memory details"
"Ensure character cultural behaviors match established backgrounds"
"Check travel times and distances for realism"
```

---

## 🔗 Cross-Domain Reference Integrity

### Knowledge Graph Reference Validation
```javascript
// Systematic cross-reference checking

// Character graph validation
"Search chapters for 'character_graph::' references"
"Verify each entity exists and details remain current"

// World graph validation  
"Search chapters for 'world_graph::' references"
"Check referenced details match current world state"

// Plot graph validation
"Search chapters for 'plot_graph::' references" 
"Ensure plot references align with story development"

// Master story validation
"Search chapters for 'master_story::' references"
"Verify high-level coordination remains accurate"
```

### Orphaned Element Detection
```javascript
// Identify underutilized story elements

// Unused character detection
"Search character_memory for characters with minimal relationships"
"Flag characters appearing in fewer than 2 chapters"

// Underutilized location detection
"Search world_memory for single-chapter-only locations"
"Identify settings with no meaningful plot impact"

// Inconsequential event detection
"Search plot_memory for events with no causal outcomes"
"Flag events that don't advance character or story development"
```

## 🤖 Quality Control Automation Tools

### Generic Language Detection Searches
```
Regular Expression Patterns:

EMOTION GENERICS:
Search: \b(felt|was|seemed)\s+(angry|sad|happy|scared|excited|worried|confused)\b
Action: Review for character-specificity and physical manifestation

ABSTRACT CONCEPTS:
Search: \b(justice|freedom|destiny|fate|humanity|evil|good)\b
Action: Review for concrete anchoring in character action

GENERIC DESCRIPTIONS:
Search: \b(very|really|quite|rather|pretty)\s+(dark|bright|loud|quiet|big|small)\b  
Action: Replace with specific sensory details

PASSIVE CONSTRUCTIONS:
Search: \b(it was|there were|things|events|stuff)\b
Action: Convert to active voice with specific agency
```

### Character Consistency Search Patterns
```
Character Voice Validation:

DIALOGUE TAG ANALYSIS:
• Search all instances of "said [character]"
• Verify dialogue matches character voice patterns
• Flag generic dialogue usable by any character

OUT-OF-CHARACTER VOCABULARY:
• Technical jargon by non-technical characters
• Formal language by informal characters  
• Cultural expressions by characters outside that culture

INCONSISTENT EMOTIONAL RESPONSES:
• Character reactions that contradict personality
• Responses that ignore established fears/triggers
• Behavioral patterns that break character consistency
```

## **Technical Issues & Solutions**

### **Knowledge Graph & MCP Server Problems**

#### **游댮 MCP Memory Server Not Responding**
**Symptoms:**
- Memory tools show "Loading..." indefinitely
- No response from memory server queries
- Server appears offline or unresponsive

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Check MCP server configuration in client settings
2. Verify memory file paths exist and are accessible
3. Test with simple memory query to isolate issue
4. Review client logs for connection errors

**Solutions:**
```
IMMEDIATE FIXES:
1. Restart MCP client (Claude Desktop/Cursor)
2. Verify memory file path exists: check ./book/memory/ directory
3. Test with simple query: "Create entity 'test' in master_story"
4. Check file permissions on memory directory

IF STILL NOT WORKING:
1. Recreate memory directory: mkdir -p ./book/memory/
2. Initialize with empty JSON: echo '{"entities":[],"relations":[]}' > master_story.json
3. Restart MCP client completely
4. Test with get_mcp_config tool to regenerate configuration

PREVENTIVE MEASURES:
- Keep memory files backed up daily
- Monitor memory server status during writing sessions
- Have fallback local notes system ready
```

#### **游리 Cross-Domain References Breaking**
**Symptoms:**
- character_graph::name references show as invalid
- Knowledge graph queries return empty results
- Cross-references between domains not working

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Query specific domain: "Search character_memory for all entities"
2. Test cross-reference format: "Show relations from protagonist_name"
3. Verify entity naming consistency across domains
4. Check for deleted or renamed entities

**Solutions:**
```
REFERENCE REPAIR PROCESS:
1. Audit all domain graphs for entity existence
2. Search manuscript for all cross-references
3. Update any references to renamed/deleted entities
4. Standardize naming conventions across domains

PREVENTION STRATEGY:
- Use consistent naming: protagonist_sarah, not Sarah or sarah_protagonist
- Document all entity names in reference sheet
- Run weekly cross-reference validation
- Use find/replace when renaming entities across manuscript
```

#### **游리 Knowledge Graph Becoming Too Large**
**Symptoms:**
- MCP queries slow to respond
- Context window overflow during chapter generation
- Memory server performance degradation

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Count entities in each domain graph
2. Measure average observations per entity
3. Identify entities with excessive detail
4. Check for duplicate or redundant information

**Solutions:**
```
GRAPH OPTIMIZATION:
1. Archive completed character arcs to separate backup graph
2. Consolidate similar entities (minor characters, similar locations)
3. Reduce observation length while maintaining specificity
4. Use federated architecture to distribute load

QUERY OPTIMIZATION:
- Target specific entities for chapter planning, not entire graphs
- Use filtered queries: "Search character_memory for protagonist only"
- Archive historical states while keeping current active information
```

### **Writing Tool Integration Issues**

#### **游리 Anti-Generalization Detection Not Working**
**Symptoms:**
- Generic language searches return no results despite obvious generic content
- Search patterns not finding vague descriptions
- Quality metrics showing false positives

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Test search patterns on known generic text
2. Verify search syntax (regex vs. plain text)
3. Check for case sensitivity issues
4. Test alternative search terms

**Solutions:**
```
SEARCH PATTERN FIXES:
- Use case-insensitive searches
- Expand search terms: "felt sad|was sad|seemed sad"
- Search for patterns, not exact phrases
- Use multiple search passes with different terms

MANUAL VALIDATION:
- Read chapters aloud to identify generic language
- Use beta readers to identify vague descriptions
- Create personal "generic language" watchlist
- Implement peer review for quality validation
```

## **Process & Workflow Issues**

### **Time Management & Productivity Problems**

#### **游리 Falling Behind Writing Schedule**
**Symptoms:**
- Missing weekly word count targets
- Phases taking longer than planned
- Quality control consuming too much time

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Track actual time spent on each phase activity
2. Identify time-consuming bottlenecks
3. Assess if targets were realistic
4. Evaluate quality vs. speed balance

**Solutions:**
```
SCHEDULE RECOVERY:
1. Adjust targets to realistic levels based on actual performance
2. Identify most time-consuming quality control steps
3. Streamline KG updates (target essentials, not perfection)
4. Consider reducing chapter count or increasing timeline

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS:
- Batch similar activities (all KG updates at once)
- Use templates and checklists to speed reviews
- Set timers for quality control activities
- Focus on high-impact quality checks first

PREVENTION:
- Track actual time for first few chapters to calibrate estimates
- Build in 25-30% buffer time for unexpected issues
- Plan shorter chapters if behind schedule
- Prioritize story completion over perfect execution
```

#### **游리 Knowledge Graph Maintenance Overwhelming**
**Symptoms:**
- KG updates taking hours per chapter
- Entities growing too complex to manage
- Cross-references becoming tangled web

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Time how long KG updates actually take
2. Identify which entities require most maintenance
3. Check for over-detailed observations
4. Assess if federated architecture is too complex

**Solutions:**
```
KG STREAMLINING:
1. Focus on essential entities only (main characters, key locations)
2. Limit observations to story-relevant details
3. Use templates for routine entity updates
4. Consider switching to simpler architecture if overwhelmed

MAINTENANCE EFFICIENCY:
- Update KGs immediately after writing, not in batches
- Use voice-to-text for faster observation entry
- Create update templates for common entity types
- Set maximum observation count per entity

SCOPE REDUCTION:
- Reduce supporting character detail level
- Consolidate similar locations or minor characters
- Focus KG detail on elements that directly impact story consistency
```

### **Quality Control Process Issues**

#### **游리 Quality Audits Finding Too Many Issues**
**Symptoms:**
- Weekly audits reveal consistent problems
- Same types of errors appearing repeatedly
- Quality metrics not improving over time

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Categorize types of issues found in audits
2. Track frequency of each problem type
3. Identify if issues are increasing or stable
4. Assess if quality standards are too high

**Solutions:**
```
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
1. Most common issue type = primary focus area
2. Check if knowledge graph entities lack needed detail
3. Verify if AI prompts include sufficient context
4. Assess if character/world development was inadequate

SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENT:
- Add specific quality checks during writing, not just review
- Enhance knowledge graph detail in problem areas
- Create reference sheets for frequent consistency issues
- Adjust writing process to prevent rather than fix problems

STANDARDS CALIBRATION:
- Ensure quality standards are achievable, not perfectionist
- Focus on most impactful quality issues first
- Allow some minor inconsistencies if story serves readers well
```

## **Content & Story Issues**

### **Character Development Problems**

#### **游댮 Characters Sound the Same**
**Symptoms:**
- Dialogue could be spoken by any character
- No distinctive voice patterns emerging
- Beta readers can't distinguish character personalities

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Read dialogue aloud - does each character sound different?
2. Check character_memory voice pattern observations
3. Analyze vocabulary complexity differences between characters
4. Test character knowledge: can you predict who would say what?

**Solutions:**
```
IMMEDIATE CHARACTER VOICE REPAIR:
1. Create voice pattern reference sheet for each character
2. Assign each character specific:
   - Vocabulary level (technical, casual, formal)
   - Sentence length preference (short/long)
   - Verbal tics or repeated phrases
   - Regional/cultural speech patterns

2. Revision pass focusing only on dialogue:
   - Read each character's lines in sequence
   - Modify vocabulary to match character education/background
   - Add character-specific verbal habits
   - Ensure emotional responses reflect individual personality

PREVENTION STRATEGIES:
- Start each writing session by reviewing character voice patterns
- Write dialogue separately from narrative to focus on voice
- Record yourself reading different characters aloud
- Create "character voice interview" exercises
```

#### **游리 Character Actions Inconsistent with Personality**
**Symptoms:**
- Characters behave against established traits
- Personality seems to change between chapters
- Character development feels unearned or sudden

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Trace character behavior across all chapters
2. Compare actions against character_memory personality traits
3. Identify where character behavior shifts occur
4. Assess if shifts have appropriate story justification

**Solutions:**
```
CHARACTER CONSISTENCY REPAIR:
1. Create character behavior timeline from existing chapters
2. Identify specific inconsistent actions
3. Either:
   - Revise actions to align with established personality, OR
   - Add story events that justify personality evolution

CHARACTER ARC STRENGTHENING:
- Ensure character growth has clear motivation
- Show internal conflict before behavioral changes
- Add transitional scenes showing character struggle
- Connect personality evolution to plot events

CONSISTENCY MAINTENANCE:
- Query character_memory before writing any character scene
- Create "character behavior prediction" exercise
- Use character fatal flaw as behavior filter
- Ask: "Would this character, given their psychology, actually do this?"
```

### **World Building & Setting Problems**

#### **游리 World Rules Being Violated**
**Symptoms:**
- Technology appearing that contradicts established tech level
- Characters using abilities not established in world rules
- Social systems applied inconsistently

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Catalog all world rule violations across manuscript
2. Check if violations are intentional plot elements
3. Assess if world rules were clearly established initially
4. Determine if rules are too restrictive for story needs

**Solutions:**
```
WORLD RULE REPAIR OPTIONS:

OPTION 1 - FIX VIOLATIONS:
1. Identify all rule violations in manuscript
2. Revise scenes to comply with established world rules
3. Find creative solutions within established constraints
4. Strengthen world_memory entities with clearer limitations

OPTION 2 - EXPAND RULES:
1. Retroactively add world rule exceptions or evolution
2. Provide story justification for rule changes
3. Update world_memory entities with expanded rules
4. Ensure new rules apply consistently throughout

WORLD CONSISTENCY MAINTENANCE:
- Query world_memory before writing any world system usage
- Create world rule quick-reference sheet
- Add world rule reminders to chapter planning sheets
- Have characters discover world rules naturally through story
```

#### **游리 Locations Feel Generic or Interchangeable**
**Symptoms:**
- Settings could be anywhere - no distinctive character
- Environmental descriptions lack specific details
- Locations don't affect character behavior or mood

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Read location descriptions - are they specific or generic?
2. Check if locations have unique environmental or social features
3. Assess if characters interact differently in different settings
4. Determine if locations serve specific story functions

**Solutions:**
```
LOCATION ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY:
1. Give each location a distinctive "personality":
   - Unique sensory signature (sounds, smells, lighting)
   - Specific social dynamics or power structures
   - Architectural/environmental features that affect behavior

2. Connect locations to character development:
   - How does this setting make protagonist feel?
   - What memories or associations does location trigger?
   - How does location constrain or enable character actions?

ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIFICITY:
- Add location-specific sensory details to every scene
- Show how environment affects character mood/behavior
- Use location constraints to create story tension
- Make locations reflect themes or character psychology
```

### **Plot Development Issues**

#### **游댮 Plot Holes or Logic Gaps**
**Symptoms:**
- Events happen without clear causation
- Character motivations unclear or contradictory
- Story developments feel arbitrary or coincidental

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Trace causality chain for all major plot events
2. Verify each event has clear character motivation
3. Check if all story setup pays off appropriately
4. Assess if plot depends on coincidence or luck

**Solutions:**
```
PLOT HOLE REPAIR PROCESS:
1. Create timeline of all plot events
2. For each event, identify:
   - What caused this event?
   - Who wanted this to happen and why?
   - What are the logical consequences?

3. Fill gaps with:
   - Character motivation scenes
   - Setup/foreshadowing additions
   - Causal connecting events
   - Character agency enhancements

CAUSALITY STRENGTHENING:
- Every major event must be driven by character choice
- Every character choice must flow from established personality
- Every consequence must affect future character choices
- Minimize coincidence - maximize character agency
```

#### **游리 Pacing Issues (Too Fast/Too Slow)**
**Symptoms:**
- Story rushes through important developments
- Tension levels inappropriate for story beats
- Reader engagement feedback indicates pacing problems

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Map tension levels across chapter sequence
2. Identify where story accelerates/decelerates inappropriately
3. Check if chapter lengths serve pacing goals
4. Assess if character development matches plot pacing

**Solutions:**
```
PACING ADJUSTMENT STRATEGIES:

FOR TOO FAST:
- Add character reflection/processing scenes
- Expand consequences of major events
- Include character relationship development
- Show world-building details through character perspective

FOR TOO SLOW:
- Combine scenes that serve similar functions
- Increase stakes in low-tension chapters
- Add subplot complications to maintain interest
- Ensure every scene advances plot or character development

PACING CALIBRATION:
- Use beta reader feedback as pacing guide
- Read chapters aloud to feel rhythm
- Vary chapter lengths intentionally for pacing effect
- Balance action, dialogue, and introspection throughout
```

## **Quality & Consistency Issues**

### **Anti-Generalization Problems**

#### **游리 Still Finding Generic Language Despite Vigilance**
**Symptoms:**
- Quality audits reveal generic language above 5% target
- Descriptions remain vague despite revision efforts
- Characters express emotions in non-specific ways

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Identify most common types of generic language in manuscript
2. Check if detection methods are comprehensive
3. Assess if replacement strategies are effective
4. Determine if standards need adjustment

**Solutions:**
```
ENHANCED ANTI-GENERALIZATION STRATEGY:

DETECTION IMPROVEMENT:
- Expand search terms beyond basic patterns
- Use multiple detection passes with different focus
- Read chapters aloud to identify vague language
- Get fresh eyes (beta readers) to identify generic content

REPLACEMENT STRATEGY ENHANCEMENT:
- Create character-specific emotion response library
- Develop setting-specific sensory detail bank
- Use character perspective to make descriptions specific
- Show abstract concepts through concrete character actions

SYSTEMATIC APPROACH:
1. Focus on one type of generic language at a time
2. Create specific replacement templates
3. Use knowledge graph context for all replacements
4. Verify replacements align with character/world consistency
```

#### **游리 Sensory Details Feel Forced or Unnatural**
**Symptoms:**
- Sensory descriptions interrupt story flow
- Details feel added for checklist purposes, not story needs
- Reader feedback indicates "overwritten" descriptions

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Check if sensory details serve story purpose beyond anti-generalization
2. Assess if details match character perspective and attention
3. Determine if sensory anchoring frequency is appropriate
4. Evaluate if details enhance or distract from story flow

**Solutions:**
```
NATURAL SENSORY INTEGRATION:
1. Filter sensory details through character perspective:
   - What would this character notice in this emotional state?
   - What sensory details would affect character mood/behavior?
   - What details support character goals or obstacles?

2. Use sensory details functionally:
   - To establish mood or atmosphere
   - To show character emotional state
   - To advance plot or reveal character information
   - To create contrast or emphasis

INTEGRATION TECHNIQUES:
- Weave sensory details into action and dialogue
- Use character expertise to guide detail selection
- Connect sensory details to character memories or associations
- Let sensory details reveal character personality or worldview
```

### **Consistency Maintenance Issues**

#### **游리 Consistency Errors Accumulating Over Time**
**Symptoms:**
- Weekly audits find increasing number of small inconsistencies
- Character traits slowly drift from original conception
- World details gradually contradict earlier information

**Diagnosis Steps:**
1. Track error types and frequency over time
2. Identify if errors cluster around specific story elements
3. Check if knowledge graph entities are being updated properly
4. Assess if quality control procedures are being followed

**Solutions:**
```
CONSISTENCY DRIFT PREVENTION:
1. Strengthen regular quality control procedures:
   - More frequent (daily) mini-audits vs. weekly large audits
   - Focus on high-risk consistency areas
   - Use templated checks for routine validation

2. Enhance knowledge graph usage:
   - Query relevant entities before every writing session
   - Update entities immediately after each writing session
   - Create consistency reminders in writing environment

3. Systematic error correction:
   - Categorize errors by type (character, world, plot)
   - Address highest-frequency error types first
   - Create prevention measures for each error category
   - Track improvement over time
```

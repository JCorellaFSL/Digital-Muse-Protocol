# Advanced Knowledge Graph Architecture

**Federated multi-graph system for complex narrative projects and professional workflows**

---

## 🎯 When You Need Advanced Architecture

Upgrade to federated KGs when your project has:
- **Multiple POV characters** requiring separate development tracking
- **Complex world-building** with interconnected systems and locations
- **Long-form narratives** (80k+ words) with numerous plot threads
- **Team collaboration** with specialized roles (character dev, world-building, etc.)
- **Publication deadlines** requiring systematic quality control

---

## 🏗️ Federated Architecture Overview

Instead of one large knowledge graph, the federated system uses **5 specialized graphs** that work together:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│  Character KG   │    │    World KG     │    │    Plot KG      │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ • Personalities │    │ • Locations     │    │ • Events        │
│ • Relationships │    │ • World Rules   │    │ • Conflicts     │
│ • Character Arcs│    │ • Geography     │    │ • Timelines     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 │
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Master KG     │
                    │                 │
                    │ • Story Arcs    │
                    │ • Act Structure │
                    │ • Cross-refs    │
                    │ • Coordination  │
                    └─────────────────┘
                                 │
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │  Narrative KG   │
                    │                 │
                    │ • Chapters      │
                    │ • Pacing        │
                    │ • Scene Flow    │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

## 📊 Graph Domain Specialization

### 1. Master Story Graph
**Purpose**: High-level coordination and cross-domain relationships

**Entities:**
- `story_arc_1_revenge`, `story_arc_2_redemption`, `story_arc_3_resolution`
- `act_1_setup`, `act_2_confrontation`, `act_3_resolution`

**Cross-Domain References:**
```json
{
  "name": "story_arc_1_revenge",
  "entityType": "story_arc",
  "observations": [
    "Spans chapters 1-8, focuses on Sarah's discovery of betrayal",
    "Primary character: character_graph::Sarah_Chen",

    "Age 32, MIT cybersecurity PhD, specializes in AI behavioral analysis",
    "Fatal flaw: trusts algorithmic solutions over human intuition",
    "Voice: Technical precision with underlying vulnerability",
    "Arc: naive_technologist → questioning_expert → wise_leader",
    "Physical: 5'6\", short black hair, always wears vintage band t-shirts",
    "Cross-ref: master_story::story_arc_1_revenge (primary character)"
  ]
}
```

### 3. World Graph
**Purpose**: Locations, systems, and world-building rules

    "Technology: holographic ads, neural enhancement districts",
    "Cross-ref: character_graph::Sarah_Chen (lives in Sector 7-G)"
  ]
}
```

### 4. Plot Graph
**Purpose**: Events, conflicts, and causal relationships

**Entities:**
- Major events: `inciting_incident`, `mentor_betrayal_reveal`, `final_confrontation`

  "name": "mentor_betrayal_reveal",
  "entityType": "major_plot_event",
  "observations": [
    "Chapter 3 climax: Sarah discovers Dr. Kim sold research to MegaCorp",
    "Emotional impact: trust → betrayal → determination",
    "Consequences: Sarah goes underground, allies with Marcus",
    "Evidence: encrypted files on Dr. Kim's personal server",
    "Cross-ref: character_graph::Sarah_Chen (character development trigger)"
  ]
}
```

### 5. Narrative Graph
**Purpose**: Chapter structure, pacing, and scene flow

**Entities:**
- Chapters: `chapter_01_setup`, `chapter_02_inciting_incident`
- Scenes: `opening_cafe_scene`, `betrayal_discovery_scene`
- Pacing elements: `action_sequence_1`, `character_development_beat_3`

**Structure Tracking:**
```json
{
  "name": "chapter_03_betrayal",
  "entityType": "chapter",
  "observations": [
    "Word count: 3,247, pacing: slow build to explosive climax",
    "POV: Sarah (first person), emotional arc: trust → shock → anger",
    "Key scene: confrontation in Dr. Kim's office",
    "Plot advancement: plot_graph::mentor_betrayal_reveal",
    "Character development: character_graph::Sarah_Chen (trust flaw exposed)"
  ]
}
```

## 🔄 Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Graph Query Strategy
For complex scenes, query across multiple graphs:

1. **Scene Setup**: 
   - `narrative_memory`: What's the chapter's emotional goal?
   - `world_memory`: What's the specific setting and its rules?

2. **Character Behavior**:
   - `character_memory`: How does this character typically react?
   - `plot_memory`: What plot pressures are affecting them?

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - `master_story`: Does this align with overall arc?
   - Cross-reference all affected domains

### Team Collaboration Workflows

**Character Specialist** (focuses on `character_memory`):
- Develops character voices, relationships, and arcs
- Updates character observations after each chapter
- Validates character consistency across scenes

**World Builder** (focuses on `world_memory`):
- Maintains location details and world rules
- Ensures environmental consistency
- Tracks world-state changes due to plot events

**Plot Coordinator** (focuses on `plot_memory` + `master_story`):
- Manages story arc progression and causality
- Ensures plot threads remain interconnected
- Validates timeline and event sequences

**Scene Writer** (uses all graphs):
- Queries relevant graphs before writing each scene
- Updates appropriate graphs with new developments
- Ensures cross-domain consistency

---

## 🎯 Advanced Quality Control

### Cross-Graph Validation Procedures

**Weekly Consistency Audits:**
1. **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Ensure all cross-domain references are valid
2. **Character Development Tracking**: Validate character arcs against plot events
3. **World State Consistency**: Check that world changes align with plot progression
4. **Narrative Pacing Analysis**: Ensure chapter progression supports story goals

**Quality Control Queries:**
```javascript
// Example: Validate character behavior consistency
// Query character_memory for Sarah_Chen's established traits
// Cross-check with recent narrative_memory entries
// Ensure behavior aligns with character arc progression
```

### Automated Validation Scripts
Consider implementing validation scripts that:
- Check for broken cross-references between graphs
- Validate that major plot events have character consequences
- Ensure world rules remain consistent across chapters
- Track character development against established arcs

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Graph Size Management
- **Character Graph**: Target 50-200 entities for major characters
- **World Graph**: Focus on 20-100 key locations and systems
- **Plot Graph**: Track 30-150 significant events and conflicts
- **Narrative Graph**: One entity per chapter/major scene
- **Master Graph**: 10-50 high-level coordination entities

### Query Optimization
- Use specific entity names rather than broad searches
- Limit observation updates to significant developments
- Archive completed story arcs to separate graphs for very long projects
- Regular cleanup of obsolete relations and entities

---

## 🚀 Scaling to Professional Projects

### Enterprise Features
- **Version Control Integration**: Sync graphs with Git commits
- **Team Permission Management**: Role-based access to specific graphs
- **Automated Backup Systems**: Regular graph state preservation
- **Publishing Pipeline Integration**: Quality gates for professional release

### Multi-Project Architecture
For professional writers managing multiple projects:
- Separate federated systems per project
- Shared character/world graphs for series continuity
- Template graphs for rapid project initialization
- Cross-project reference systems for shared universes

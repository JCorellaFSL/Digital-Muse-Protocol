# Digital Muse Protocol - Getting Started Guide

**AI-Assisted Fiction Generation with Perfect Memory**

> Transform AI from a "blank slate" content generator into a **context-aware creative partner** with persistent memory, systematic consistency enforcement, and professional-grade output quality.

## üéØ What is the Digital Muse Protocol?

The Digital Muse Protocol is a **systematic methodology** for generating novel-length fiction using AI while maintaining the **consistency and depth** readers expect from professional literature.

### The Core Problem It Solves

Traditional AI writing suffers from two critical weaknesses:
1. **"Blank Slate Syndrome"** - AI forgets established characters, world rules, and plot threads between sessions
2. **"Generic Generalization"** - AI produces vague, sweeping statements instead of specific, grounded prose

### The Solution: Federated Knowledge Graphs + Anti-Generalization Techniques

The Digital Muse Protocol employs **persistent knowledge graphs** that serve as the AI's "memory" and **systematic anti-generalization techniques** that force specific, character-grounded prose.

## üß† Knowledge Graph Memory Setup

**The Digital Muse Protocol's key innovation**: Persistent, federated knowledge graphs that serve as the "memory" of your writing project.

### Simple Setup (Single Graph)
Use `mcp_memory_config.json` for straightforward projects:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dm_protocol_memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Setup (Federated System)
Use `federated_mcp_config.json` for complex projects with 5 specialized graphs:
- **Master Graph**: Overall story coordination
- **Character Graph**: Personalities and relationships
- **World Graph**: Locations and world-building
- **Plot Graph**: Events and causality
- **Narrative Graph**: Structure and pacing
